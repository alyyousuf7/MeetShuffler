# Shuffler - A Google Meet Extension
Shuffler is a utility to post a randomized list of attendees to chat on Google Meet.

The original reason to build this extension was to help our team to randomize the order of people speaking in our daily stand ups.

People joining the meeting late? No worries, it will put them last in the queue and post the list once again for them.

To kick off the extension, click the Shuffler icon after joining the meeting.

There are a few commands that you can type in chat:

| Command | Description |
|-|-|
| `/shuffler` | (Re)start the shuffler - used to randomize the list again |
| `/shuffler off` | Stop the shuffler - do not act when anyone joins |
| `/relist` | Print the list again |
| `/pick [n]` | Randomly pick `n` people |
