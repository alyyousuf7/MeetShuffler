# Shuffler - A Google Meet Extension
Shuffler is a utility to post a randomized list of attendees to chat on Google Meet.

The original reason to build this extension was to help our team to randomize the order of people speaking in our daily stand ups.

To kick off the extension, click the Shuffler icon after joining the meeting.

There are a few commands that you can type in chat:

| Command | Description |
|-|-|
| `/shuffle` | Randomizes the list (again) |
| `/relist` | Prints the list again |

People joining the meeting late? No worries, it will put them last in the queue and post the list once again for them.
